# Card Update

## Deprecation

| ❗️ Please note that Chargify Direct has been deprecated in favor of Chargify.js |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Chargify.js is a PCI compliant way of embedding payment forms on your site, while still making full use of our powerful API.

While Chargify Direct will still function and be supported, no new enhancements or features will be added.

## Chargify Direct

Updating a Subscription’s Payment Profile via Chargify Direct with new information, or creating a new Payment Profile for a Subscription where none currently exists.

## URI/Method

The card_update endpoint is only available for HTML forms and does not respond to JSON API calls.

## Input Attributes

In order for your request to be processed, you must set up secure parameters.
See [Chargify Direct Introduction – Secure Parameters](page:chargify-direct/authentication#chargify-direct-via-secure-parameters)
for detailed information on how to authenticate requests to this endpoint.

Note: the `subscription_id` **MUST** be part of your `secure[data]` parameter for the card update request to be processed.

### Taxable Subscriptions

❗️ If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to update the `payment_profile`,
complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https://developers.maxio.com/docs/developer-docs/d2e9e34db740e-signups#taxes).

## Reference implementation

The small Sinatra app constructed to serve as a reference implementation for Chargify Direct includes an example
flow for a card update and is available here:

[https://github.com/chargify/chargify_direct_example](https://github.com/chargify/chargify_direct_example)

When the application is run, navigating to `http://localhost:9292/card_update/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` where `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`
is a numeric subscription ID, the user is presented with a form to input the updated card information.
If an error occurs after submitting, the form will be redisplayed along with error messaging.
Otherwise, a success message is displayed along with the URI for retrieving the call data from the API V2.

## Output Attributes

When Chargify redirects back to your redirect URI, it will include the following query-string parameters:

| `api_id`      | The API ID that made the original request                                                                                                                                       |

| `result_code` | A Chargify-specific result code, that is related to the status code but may give more specific information about the result of your request                                     |
| `call_id`     | The ID for the stored representation of the original Call (form post). The Call may be fetched via the API for full response information (for both success and fail scenarios). |
