In the "Awaiting Signup" state, a subscription behaves like any other. It can be canceled, allocated to, had its billing date changed. etc. When the initial_billing_at date hits, the subscription will transition to the expected state. If the product has a trial, the subscription will enter a trial, otherwise it will go active. Setup fees will be respected either before or after the trial, as configured on the price point. If the payment is due at the initial_billing_at and it fails the subscription will be immediately canceled. See further notes in the section on Delayed Signups.'
