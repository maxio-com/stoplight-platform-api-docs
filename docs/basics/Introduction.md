# Introduction

## API Integration

Chargify can be integrated with many environments and programming languages via our REST API. Some of our users have contributed their API wrappers in various programming languages. Check out the [API Code Overview](https://developer.chargify.com/content/ecosystem/api-code-samples.html) doc for an introduction to the wrappers and available code samples.

## Developer Portal

We've created a developer focused portal to give your organization a clear and quick overview of how to integrate with Chargify. 

The developer portal focuses on scenarios for integration and flow of events. We recommend familiarizing yourself with all of the content in the developer portal, as it's a great compliment to our API documentation.

Here is a sampling of what is available in the developer portal:

+ [Getting Started Guide for Integrators:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/getting-started/authentication.html) Authentication, Guidelines, Sites/Subdomains
+ [API Basics:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html) Signups, Components, Syncing
+ [Chargify Ecosystem:](https://developer.chargify.com/content/ecosystem/ecosystem.html) Code samples, Signup methods

## Chargify.js

Our [Chargify.js documentation](https://developer.chargify.com/content/chargify-js/chargify-js.html) can be found under the developer portal. 

Here you'll find an introduction to how Chargify.js allows you to tokenize sensitive information such as card numbers. Additionally, we cover some example implementations, as well as troubleshooting.

## Testing Guide

Chargify has compiled a [testing guide](https://help.chargify.com/testing/testing-intro.html) that covers a list of important factors to consider while in the testing phase. Here's a high-level overiew of what's covered in our testing guide:

+ Test credit card basics
+ Test site limits
+ Live mode versus test mode

We strongly suggest reading over the testing guide, as well as the entire set of application-based documentation to aid in your discovery of the product.

## Engage Support

We always enjoy (and appreciate) hearing about larger integrations ahead of time. If you’re planning on importing a large amount of data into Chargify via our API, we suggest sending a “heads up” to “support@chargify.com” so we can coordinate with you to ensure your import process goes smoothly.

Our API, while considered stable, is continually being improved and polished. Please feel free to contact support if you experience issues when integrating with the Chargify API.

## Support Access

Access to our Technical Specialist team for API support is currently limited to purchasers of our larger Chargify support plans.
