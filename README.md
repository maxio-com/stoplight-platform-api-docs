# Chargify API Documentation

The Chargify API is documented in this repository using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). It may be used as reference when building interactions with the Chargify API.

### Development

If you are a Chargify developer and need to make changes to the API documentation, please refer to our internal documentation on Stoplight Studio.

## SDK generation
This repository is used for SDK generation. It's important to keep specification compatible with our generators.
You cannot merge your PR if SDK generation fails. 
Check output of `Validate specification and build SDKs` pipeline in GitHub Actions if your build fails.
Look at `Build SDKs` step, here is a sample error message:

```text
> Task :validateSpec
Validating spec ../reference/Chargify-API.v1.yaml

Spec has issues or recommendations.

...
...

Spec is invalid.
Issues:

	attribute paths.'/webhooks/replay.json'(post).responses.200.content.'examples'.Example is unexpected
```

It's useful to look at the pipeline output even if it's green as it might contain some warnings which can influence generated code.

### How it works
We are using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to generate our SDKs.
Configuration of generators are stored in repository [sdk-generator](https://github.com/maxio-com/sdk-generator).
When PR is opened in `stoplight-platform-api-docs` with target branch `main`/`staging` then `build-sdk` pipeline is run to validate specification.

`publish-sdk` workflow is run manually - it generates code for specified languages, pushes generated code to respective SDK repositories and opens PR in GitHub.
