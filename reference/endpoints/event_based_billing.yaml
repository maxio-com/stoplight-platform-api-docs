      In order to bill your subscribers on your Events data under the Events-Based Billing feature, the components must be activated for the subscriber.

      Learn more about the role of activation in the [Events-Based Billing docs](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407720810907#activating-components-for-subscribers).

      Use this endpoint to activate an event-based component for a single subscription. Activating an event-based component causes Chargify to bill for events when the subscription is renewed.

      *Note: it is possible to stream events for a subscription at any time, regardless of component activation status. The activation status only determines if the subscription should be billed for event-based component usage at renewal.*
