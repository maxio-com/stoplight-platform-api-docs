      This endpoint allows you to create and/or update currency prices for an existing coupon. Multiple prices can be created or updated in a single request but each of the currencies must be defined on the site level already and the coupon must be an amount-based coupon, not percentage.

      Currency pricing for coupons must mirror the setup of the primary coupon pricing - if the primary coupon is percentage based, you will not be able to define pricing in non-primary currencies.
