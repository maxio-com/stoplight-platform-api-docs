      You may create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one customer for a given reference value.

      If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the customer from your own app, i.e. the customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

      Full documentation on how to locate, create and edit Customers in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407659914267).

      ## Required Country Format

      Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard Country codes when formatting country attribute of the customer.

      Countries should be formatted as 2 characters. For more information, please see the following wikipedia article on [ISO_3166-1.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes)

      ## Required State Format

      Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard State codes when formatting state attribute of the customer.

      + US States (2 characters): [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US)

      + States Outside the US (2-3 characters): To find the correct state codes outside of the US, please go to [ISO_3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) and click on the link in the “ISO 3166-2 codes” column next to country you wish to populate.

      ## Locale

      Chargify allows you to attribute a language/region to your customer to deliver invoices in any required language.

      ## Find Customer

      Use the search feature with the `q` query parameter to retrieve an array of customers that matches the search query.

      Common use cases are:

      + Search by an email
      + Search by a Chargify ID
      + Search by an organization
      + Search by a reference value from your application
      + Search by a first or last name

      To retrieve a single, exact match by reference, please use the [lookup endpoint](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/api-docs/b710d8fbef104-read-customer-by-reference).
