      This endpoint allows you to create currency prices for a given currency that has been defined on the site level in your settings.

      When creating currency prices, they need to mirror the structure of your primary pricing. For each price level defined on the component price point, there should be a matching price level created in the given currency.

      Note: Currency Prices are not able to be created for custom price points.
