      The Stats API is a very basic view of some Site-level stats. This API call only answers with JSON responses. An XML version is not provided.

      ## Stats Documentation

      There currently is not a complimentary matching set of documentation that compliments this endpoint. However, each Site's dashboard will reflect the summary of information provided in the Stats reposnse.
