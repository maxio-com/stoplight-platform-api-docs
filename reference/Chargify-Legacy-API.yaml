        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        Creating a charge requires a valid, live subscription (i.e. subscriptions that are not canceled or expired). The subscription must be referenced by `subscription_id`.
        When a charge is created, a payment in the amount of the assessed charge is automatically captured from the credit card on file for the subscription. For this purpose, the subscription must have a payment method in order to support adding a charge. Payment collection will not be attempted if:
        + the subscription is on legacy invoice billing
        + the charge is accrued to the next renewal (`delay_capture` = true)
        ## 3d secure requirement

        If for given subscription there is a pending 3ds payment, which was not
        yet confirmed, you will not be able to apply any charge for this
        subscription until 3ds transaction will not be confirmed.

        The only case which allows it, is when you accrue charge until next
        renewal (`delay_capture` = true) option and the subscription is in an active state.
        ## Limitations of attribute combinations
        When you add a charge to an existing subscription, you may not use the following combination of attribute values:
        + `delay_capture` = true
        + `accrue_on_failure` = true
        ## Help Documentation
        This method of recording a charge against a subscription is referred to as a **"One-time Charge"** in the Chargify Help Documentation.
        Full documentation on how to record a One-time Charge in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407897565723).

        ## External Payments
        Chargify allows you to record payments that occur **outside** of the normal flow of payment processing.
        These payments are considered **external payments**. A common case to apply such a payment is when a customer pays by check or some other means for their subscription.
        Full documentation on how to record external payments in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407895937819#process-refund).

        ## Refunds
        With Chargify you have the ability to apply a refund to a payment that has been processed at the gateway. There are two types of refunds:
        - **Internal** - a refund which interacts with the Gateway to return the amount back to the customer
        - **External** - a refund which _records_ a return which occurred outside of Chargify. No funds are returned to the customer 
        Note that external refunds will reduce revenue, but they do not affect the balance due for the subscription.
        For more information on creating refunds in general, please see [Refunds](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407898813851).

        ## External Refund Use Cases
         
        The use case for this type of refund is as follows:
        + You have a gateway that does not do **direct** refunds back to a Customer's bank account
        + To process a refund, you process the refund **through** your gateway account.
        + Afterwards, record the refund within Chargify
        ## Supported Gateways
        Interal refunds are only supported for the following gateways:
        + Authorize.Net
        + Braintree Blue
        + CyberSource
        + Elavon
        + eWay Rapid
        + Litle
        + Moneris
        + Orbital
        + Payeezy (First Data)
        + Pin Payments
        + Payment Express
        + Paymill
        + QuickPay
        + Stripe
        + Trust Commerce

        ### Errors

        + Memo: cannot be blank.
        + Amount: is not a number.
        + Amount: must be greater than or equal to 0.

        This method will return the full list of transactions for a Site. Pay close attention to filters and pagination in order to control results.
        **Notes about ID/Date Filters**
        - Using `since_id` and/or `max_id` is known as creating an “ID Filter”.
        - Using `since_date` and/or `until_date` is known as creating a “Date Filter”.
        - You may ONLY make use of either an ID Filter or a Date Filter in any one request.
        - If you specify both an ID Filter and a Date Filter, the Date Filter will be ignored.
        **Pagination Notes**
        Stepping through pages of results by incrementing the page number is typically less performant than using an ID Filter with `since_id`, especially at high values of page.
        For example, instead of these successive requests to traverse pagination:
            GET /transactions.json?page=1&per_page=200
            GET /transactions.json?page=2&per_page=200
        It is usually faster to use `since_id` to continue fetching from the last ID you observed:
            GET /transactions.json?since_id=0&per_page=200&direction=asc
            GET /transactions.json?since_id=1567&per_page=200&direction=asc
        In the above example, 1567 is derived by adding 1 to the “last” ID you received from the first request.

        ## Statements Intro
        Chargify Statements give you and your customers a breakdown of Subscription charges, payments, credits, and activity on a period-by-period basis. A Statement is similar to an “Invoice” because it is marked as currently paid or unpaid. Statements display all account activity for a specific usage period.
        Documentation for Statements in the Chargify UI can be accessed via the following links / topics:
        + [Statements Reference](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407895493787)
        + [Viewing Statements](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#statements)
        + [Statement Settings](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407870517019)
        ## Statement Presentation
        The Statements API offers three ways to easily render a statement on your site. You can include a text representation of the statement or one of two HTML views that can be styled to your liking.

        | text_view       | A text representation of the statement             |
        |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
        | basic_html_view | A simple HTML representation of the statement      |
        | html_view       | A more robust HTML representation of the statement |

        Rendering individual statements can also be done as PDF by using the Accept/Content-Type header application/pdf or appending .pdf as the `<format>` portion of the URL: `/statements/1.pdf`.

        | ❗️  This endpoint is only for subscriptions using Legacy Statement Billing  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        This method will return a paginated list of all Statements generated by the Subscriptions in your Site.
        Note that this endpoint returns a "lighter" set of the Statement attributes than the "List Statements for a Subscription" endpoint.  This endpoint omits the HTML and textual representations for the Statement: `basic_html_view`, `html_view`, and `text_view`.  If you require these attributes, you can either build them yourself based on the other data returned or fetch a single subscription via the "Read/Show by Chargify ID" endpoint.

        ```
        {
          "payment": {
            "amount": 10.00,
            "memo": "Lorem ipsum"
          }
        }

        | ❗️  This endpoint is only for subscriptions using Legacy Statement Billing  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        If you are on the legacy architecture, Chargify offers the ability to reset the balance of a subscription to zero. Attempting to use this endpoint on a Relationship Invoicing site will not work; In order to reduce the balance of a subscription, please void or apply a service credit directly to an invoice.
        If a Subscription has a positive balance, this API call will issue a credit to the Subscription for the outstanding balance.
        This is particularly helpful if you want to reactivate a canceled Subscription without charging the Customer for their previously owed balance.
        ## Past Due & Unpaid Subscriptions
        If you have a subscription that is in the `past_due` or `unpaid` state, when you reset the balance, the subscription will transition to `active`.
