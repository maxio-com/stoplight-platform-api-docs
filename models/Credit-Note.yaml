  subtotal_amount:
    type: string
    description: Subtotal of the credit note, which is the sum of all line items before
      discounts or taxes. Note that this is a positive amount representing the credit
      back to the customer.
  discount_amount:
    type: string
    description: Total discount applied to the credit note. Note that this is a positive
      amount representing the discount amount being credited back to the customer
      (i.e. a credit on an earlier discount). For example, if the original purchase
      was $1.00 and the original discount was $0.10, a credit of $0.50 of the original
      purchase (half) would have a discount credit of $0.05 (also half).
  tax_amount:
    type: string
    description: Total tax of the credit note. Note that this is a positive amount
      representing a previously taxex amount being credited back to the customer (i.e.
      a credit of an earlier tax). For example, if the original purchase was $1.00
      and the original tax was $0.10, a credit of $0.50 of the original purchase (half)
      would also have a tax credit of $0.05 (also half).
  total_amount:
    type: string
    description: The credit note total, which is `subtotal_amount - discount_amount
      + tax_amount`.'
  applied_amount:
    type: string
    description: The amount of the credit note that has already been applied to invoices.
  remaining_amount:
    type: string
    description: The amount of the credit note remaining to be applied to invoices,
      which is `total_amount - applied_amount`.
  line_items:
    type: array

      type: object
      properties:
        uid:
          type: string
          description: Unique identifier for the line item.  Useful when cross-referencing
            the line against individual discounts in the `discounts` or `taxes` lists.
        title:
          type: string
          description: A short descriptor for the credit given by this line.
        description:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Detailed description for the credit given by this line.  May include proration details in plain text.

            Note: this string may contain line breaks that are hints for the best display format on the credit note.
        quantity:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The quantity or count of units credited by the line item.

            This is a decimal number represented as a string. (See "About Decimal Numbers".)
        unit_price:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The price per unit for the line item.

            When tiered pricing was used (i.e. not every unit was actually priced at the same price) this will be the blended average cost per unit and the `tiered_unit_price` field will be set to `true`.
        subtotal_amount:
          type: string
          description: The line subtotal, generally calculated as `quantity * unit_price`.
            This is the canonical amount of record for the line - when rounding differences
            are in play, `subtotal_amount` takes precedence over the value derived
            from `quantity * unit_price` (which may not have the proper precision
            to exactly equal this amount).
        discount_amount:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The approximate discount of just this line.

            The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total discount among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the discount to arrive at `discount_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the discount on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
        tax_amount:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The approximate tax of just this line.

            The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total tax among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the tax rate to arrive at `tax_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the tax on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
        total_amount:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The non-canonical total amount for the line.

            `subtotal_amount` is the canonical amount for a line. The invoice `total_amount` is derived from the sum of the line `subtotal_amount`s and discounts or taxes applied thereafter.  Therefore, due to rounding or precision errors, the sum of line `total_amount`s may not equal the invoice `total_amount`.
        tiered_unit_price:
          type: boolean
          description: When `true`, indicates that the actual pricing scheme for the
            line was tiered, so the `unit_price` shown is the blended average for
            all units.
        period_range_start:
          type: string
          description: Start date for the period credited by this line. The format
            is `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
        period_range_end:
          type: string
          description: End date for the period credited by this line. The format is
            `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
        product_id:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            The ID of the product being credited.

            This may be set even for component credits, so true product-only (non-component) credits will also have a nil `component_id`.
        product_version:
          type: integer
          description: The version of the product being credited.
        component_id:
          type:
          - integer
          - 'null'
          description: The ID of the component being credited. Will be `nil` for non-component
            credits.
        price_point_id:
          type:
          - integer
          - 'null'
          description: The price point ID of the component being credited. Will be
            `nil` for non-component credits.
