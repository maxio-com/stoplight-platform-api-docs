        description: The initial_billing_at attribute in Maxio allows you to specify a custom starting date for billing cycles associated with components that have their own billing frequency set (Please note this only works for site with Multifrequency enabled). This attribute is particularly useful when you need to align billing events for different components on distinct schedules within a subscription. Only ISO8601 format is supported.
